<h3 align="center">Machine Learning Introduction</h3>



- ðŸ”­ Machine Learning, often abbreviated as ML is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that works on algorithm developments and statistical models that allow computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. Hence, in simpler terms, machine learning allows computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Essentially, machine learning algorithms learn patterns and relationships from data, allowing them to generalize from instances and make predictions or conclusions on new and uncovered data.

- ðŸŒ± How does Machine Learning Work?
Broadly Machine Learning process includes Project Setup, Data Preparation, Modeling and Deployment. The following figure demonstrates the common working process of Machine Learning. It follows some set of steps to do the task; a sequential process of its workflow is as follows -

- ðŸ“« Types of Machine Learning
### Supervised Machine Learning (SVM):
 Supervised machine learning uses labeled datasets to train algorithms to classify data or predict outcomes. As input data is inputted into the model, its weights modify until it fits into the model; this process is known as cross validation which ensures the model is not overfitted or underfitted.
Supervised Machine Learning
Supervised learning helps organizations scale real-world challenges like spam classification in a different folder from your inbox. Different methods for supervised learning include neural networks, naÃ¯ve Bayes, linear regression, logistic regression, random forest, and SVM.
### Unsupervised Machine Learning: 
Unsupervised machine learning analyses and clusters unlabelled datasets using machine learning methods. The algorithms find hidden patterns or data groupings without human interaction. This method is useful for exploratory data analysis, cross-selling, consumer segmentation, and image and pattern recognition.
Unsupervised Machine Learning
It also reduces model features through dimensionality reduction using prominent methods of Principal component analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD). Neural networks, k-means clustering, and probabilistic clustering are some popular methods of unsupervised learning.
### Semi-supervised learning:
 As its name implies; Semi-supervised learning is an integration of supervised and unsupervised learning. This method uses both labeled and unlabelled data to train ML models for classification and regression tasks. Semi-supervised learning is a best practice to utilize to solve the problem where a user doesn't have enough labeled data for a supervised learning algorithm.
Semi-supervised Machine Learning
Hence, it's an appropriate method to solve the problem where data is partially labeled or unlabelled. Self-training, co-training, and graph-based labeling are some of the popular Semi-supervised learning methods.
### Reinforcement Machine Learning:
 Reinforcement machine learning is a type of machine learning model that is similar to supervised learning but does not use sample data to train the algorithm. This model learns by trial and error.
Reinforcement Machine Learning
A series of good results will be reinforced to create the optimal proposal or policy for a specific problem.

Common Machine Learning Algorithms
Several machine learning algorithms are commonly used. These include:

### Neural networks:
 Neural networks function similarly to the human brain, comprising multiple linked processing nodes. Neural networks excel at pattern identification and are used in different applications such as natural language processing, image recognition, speech recognition, and creating images.
Linear regression: This algorithm predicts numerical values using a linear relationship between variables. For example, linear regression is used to forecast housing prices based on past data in a particular area.
Logistic regression: This supervised learning method predicts categorical variables, such as "yes/no" replies to questions. It is suitable for applications such as spam classification and quality control on a production line.
Clustering: Clustering algorithms use unsupervised learning to find patterns in data and organise it accordingly. Computers can assist data scientists by identifying differences between data items that humans have overlooked.
Decision trees: Decision trees are useful for categorising data and for regression analysis, which predicts numerical values. A tree structure can be used to illustrate the branching sequence of linked decisions used in decision trees. Unlike neural networks, decision trees can be easily validated and audited.
Random forests: ML predicts a value or category by integrating results from different decision trees.
